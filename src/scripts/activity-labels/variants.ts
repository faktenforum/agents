/**
 * System-prompt and user-framing variants for the SDK-side activity-label
 * eval. Unlike the LibreChat harness this was ported from (LibreChat
 * #14527, scripts/activity-labels/), the user prompt here is rendered by
 * the REAL `buildActivityLabelPrompt` from `src/prompts/activityLabel.ts`,
 * so a prompt-builder change is measured directly instead of through a
 * hand-port that can drift.
 *
 * Two instruction baselines matter to this repo:
 *
 * - `sdk-default`  — ACTIVITY_LABEL_PROMPT, what a host gets when it passes
 *                    no `prompt`. LibreChat never exercises this in
 *                    production (it always sends its own instruction), so
 *                    this is the quality floor the SDK ships on its own.
 * - `host-shipped` — a pinned copy of LibreChat's ACTIVITY_INSTRUCTION
 *                    (packages/api/src/agents/activityLabels/runtime.ts at
 *                    dev@a07c0e4ae8), the string every production label
 *                    call actually receives. It is a FIXTURE: if LibreChat
 *                    changes its instruction, update this copy.
 *
 * Framing variants (`entriesHeading` / `terminal`) are HYPOTHESES about the
 * builder: the runner applies them as marker-exact substitutions on the
 * built prompt. When one wins and the builder adopts it, the variant
 * becomes the baseline and the substitution no-ops.
