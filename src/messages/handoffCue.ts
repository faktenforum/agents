/**
 * Appends a user-turn handoff cue when a payload ends with an assistant turn
 * that THIS RUN produced — which only happens when a different agent in a
 * multi-agent workflow produced it (an agent's own self-loops always re-enter
 * on a tool result or an injected user turn).
 *
 * Why: providers with prefill semantics (Anthropic, Bedrock-Claude) treat a
 * trailing assistant message as a prefill and CONTINUE it. A bare direct-edge
 * successor therefore speaks in its predecessor's voice — or, when the
 * trailing turn reads complete (a preemption steer's short resume, say),
 * returns empty content (danny-avila/agents#345, reproduced live 3/3).
 * Handoff edges with instructions and prompt-instruction edges already break
 * the prefill with a user turn; this closes the same gap for bare edges.
 *
 * Fail-safe OFF by provenance: the trailing payload message must be one the
 * run itself produced (`isRunProduced`, backed by the graph's run-produced id
 * set — immune to summarization compaction, which rewrites the live array
 * and stales index-based boundaries). Host-supplied trailing assistant
 * turns (deliberate prefill flows) never match — the run has not produced
 * them — so single-agent prefill behavior is untouched. Wire-only: the cue is
 * appended to the provider projection, never to graph state or host history.
