/**
 * Anthropic prompt-caching helper for the `tools[]` request field.
 *
 * Anthropic accepts `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` on individual
 * tool definitions. Whichever tool carries the marker becomes the end of
 * a cached prefix: `tools[0..N]` (everything up to and including the
 * marked tool) is cached and rebated on subsequent matching requests.
 *
 * For agents that mix static and deferred (lazily-discovered) tools, the
 * winning configuration is:
 *
 *   1. Stable-partition tools so all *static* (non-deferred) tools come
 *      first and discovered-deferred tools come last.
 *   2. Stamp `cache_control` on the LAST static tool.
 *
 * That way, the cached prefix covers exactly the static tool inventory.
 * Discovered tools that show up later (or vary turn-to-turn as new ones
 * get discovered) never invalidate the prefix because they sit *after*
 * the breakpoint.
 *
 * LangChain's Anthropic adapter passes the marker through via
 * `tool.extras.cache_control` for custom tools, while Anthropic built-ins
 * require direct `cache_control`. Either way, we stamp a fresh wrapper —
 * never mutating the original tool instance, since callers may share them
 * across runs.
