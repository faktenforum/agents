/**
 * @fileoverview Tool intent labels.
 *
 * Lets a tool declare, as the FIRST property of its input schema, an `intent`
 * string: one model-authored sentence stating what that specific call is about
 * to do ("Searching for OAuth handling in the callback router"). Because the
 * property is first, it is the first key providers stream in the tool-call
 * args, so a host UI can render it as the call's live status label before the
 * rest of the args exist. When the call settles, {@link applyOutcome} edits
 * the sentence in place into its outcome form — a tool-supplied replacement
 * (`outcome`) or a tool-supplied span edit (`outcome_patch`). Absent either,
 * the label is left exactly as the model wrote it: completion is a UI state
 * (the shimmer stopping, the icon settling), not a tense change.
 *
 * The arg is always optional (never listed in `required`): the same schemas
 * are callable from programmatic tool calling, where no UI renders a label
 * and forcing generated code to fabricate one would be pure cost. Tool bodies
 * must call {@link stripIntent} before using their args so no tool receives a
 * parameter it did not declare.
